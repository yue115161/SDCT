# SDCT
Please download the code "SDCT_CSDN发布.rar" directly. The code of paper "Robust Descriptor Algorithm Considering the Changing Gray Value Trends Inside Ground Objects for Heterogeneous Optical Image Matching".

This code is written in C#. If you only use this code for image matching, you only need to run the SDCT_CSDN发布.exe file in the " SDCT_CSDN发布\SDCT_CSDN发布\bin\x64\Debug" directory. If you need to change the code, please use the Visual Studio platform (I am using Visual Studio2017). The code uses the SDCT algorithm (paper: Robust Descriptor Algorithm Considering the Changing Gray Value Trends Inside Ground Objects for Heterogeneous Optical Image Matching). Its main feature is that the superior stability and capability of the proposed algorithm over commonly used algorithms, including the radiation-invariant feature transform, adaptive binning SIFT, gradient orientation modification SIFT, and LSS algorithms. You are welcome to cite my paper. If you have any questions, please contact me (email: 1151617653@qq.com). Commercial use of this code is prohibited. I wish you all a happy life and successful scientific research!
